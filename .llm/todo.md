## Current: Issue #1104 — Wire RecordingEngine to UI

- [ ] Write failing tests: arm button renders, toggles, visual state
- [ ] Add arm button to TrackHeader (non-group tracks only)
- [ ] Verify toolbar record button works (no regression)
- [ ] All quality gates pass: tsc, tests, build

## Priority 1: Test Coverage Foundation

- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for uiStore (panel toggles, selection state)
- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for generationStore (queue management, status)
- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for color utilities (src/utils/color.ts)
- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for WAV export utilities (src/utils/wav.ts)
- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for waveformPeaks calculation (src/utils/waveformPeaks.ts)
- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for audio downsample utility (src/utils/audioDownsample.ts)
- [ ] Write Vitest unit tests for generationPipeline service state machine
- [x] Write Vitest unit tests for automation types (normalizedToMixerValue, automationParamEquals)
- [x] Write Playwright E2E test: sequencer workflow (add track, toggle steps, verify pattern)
- [x] Write Playwright E2E test: piano roll workflow (add track, add notes via store API)
- [x] Write Playwright E2E test: mixer operations (volume, pan, mute, solo)
- [ ] Write Playwright E2E test: effect chain (add/remove/reorder effects)
- [ ] Write Playwright E2E test: keyboard shortcuts (Space=play, Ctrl+Z=undo)

## Priority 2: Feature Gaps (from competitive research)

(populated by @researcher agent)

## Priority 3: Refactoring

(populated by @refactorer agent)

## Design Debt (from /plan-design-review)

- [ ] Add first-use tooltip/hint in StrudelEditor for Strudel syntax onboarding (depends on Phase 1 StrudelEditor component)

## Engineering Debt (from /plan-eng-review)

- [ ] Add lazy loading error boundary component for StrudelEditor (and future lazy-loaded features) — prevents white screen on chunk load failure, shows "Failed to load. Click to retry." (depends on React.lazy introduction in Phase 1)
- [ ] Add Strudel engine structured console logging (eval count/timing, errors, preset usage) — enables debugging and adoption tracking. Use console.debug for metrics, console.warn for errors. (P2, depends on Phase 1 StrudelEngine)
