## Research Depth Standard

Every feature must be researched at interaction-detail level before coding.

### Bad (too shallow)
> "Ableton has Group Tracks"

### Good (deep enough)
> "Ableton Group Track: nestable, folded view shows sub-clip overview, Session View group slots have independent launch/stop, Cmd+Click for multi-select grouping, group color can be applied to all sub-tracks, output defaults to Group Track but can be rerouted, can serve as pure folder, deleting Group deletes all contents, Ungroup reverts to individual tracks"

### Research output
- Save to `docs/research-notes/<feature>-details.md`
- Include: interaction details, parameter ranges, edge cases, shortcuts, visual feedback, error handling

## System Test Checklist (Every 5 Versions)

Use the QA matrix before running a large test pass:

- Generate the release-critical runlist: `npm run qa:runlist`
- Generate a broader regression runlist: `npm run qa:runlist -- --status=release-critical,core-regression`
- Validate story references before handoff: `npm run qa:validate`
- Use `--format=json` or `--output=...` when handing the runlist to another agent or attaching it to a report

### Cold Start
- [ ] Clear browser cache / IndexedDB
- [ ] Open app from scratch
- [ ] Verify all components render correctly

### Full User Journey
- [ ] Create new project (name, BPM, key, time signature)
- [ ] Add Stems track → generate with AI → verify playback
- [ ] Add Piano Roll track → draw MIDI notes → verify synth playback
- [ ] Add Sequencer track → program drum pattern → verify playback
- [ ] Add Sample track → import audio file → verify playback
- [ ] Open Mixer → adjust volume/pan/mute/solo per track
- [ ] Add effects to a track → verify effect chain UI
- [ ] Multi-track playback → verify all tracks play in sync
- [ ] Export project to WAV → verify output file
- [ ] Save project → close → reopen → verify all data persists

### AI Features
- [ ] Generate track via LEGO pipeline (context-aware)
- [ ] Create Cover from existing clip
- [ ] Repaint selection on a clip
- [ ] Vocal2BGM generation
- [ ] Audio Analysis (BPM/key detection)
- [ ] Model selector in Settings

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Rapid button clicking (transport, add track, etc.)
- [ ] Extreme zoom (min/max)
- [ ] Empty project with all operations
- [ ] 10+ tracks performance
- [ ] Browser resize / responsive behavior
- [ ] Network offline behavior (generation should show clear error)

### Visual Audit
- [ ] Dark theme consistency across all panels
- [ ] Button states (hover, active, disabled) all correct
- [ ] Text readability (no truncated labels)
- [ ] Alignment and spacing consistency
- [ ] No overlapping elements

### Agent Usability (every feature, every version)
- [ ] All new interactive elements have `aria-label` or `role` attributes
- [ ] New features are accessible via `window.__store` API (not just UI clicks)
- [ ] User story tested as agent: program a beat, write a melody, adjust mixer, trigger generation — all via store API or DOM automation
- [ ] Canvas-based features have equivalent programmatic API (e.g. Piano Roll → `addMidiNote`)
- [ ] Default scroll/zoom positions open to the most useful view (not blank/extreme ranges)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts documented and working for all new toolbar actions

### Code Quality
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
- [ ] `npm run build` — passes
- [ ] Zero unused imports
- [ ] Zero console.log (except error handlers)
- [ ] Zero untyped `any`
- [ ] Components under 600 lines (split if larger)
- [ ] All useEffect have cleanup returns where needed
- [ ] All event listeners properly removed
