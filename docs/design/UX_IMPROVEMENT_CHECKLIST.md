## P0 — Critical (Must Ship)

### Core Audio & Transport
- ✅ **Audio context management** — Resume AudioContext on first user gesture (click/tap). Show clear "Click to enable audio" overlay if context is suspended. *Ref: Web Audio autoplay policy*
- ⬜ **Latency calibration** — Auto-detect `audioContext.outputLatency + baseLatency` on first use. Display detected latency in settings. Allow manual override.
- ⬜ **Lookahead scheduling** — Set Tone.js `lookAhead` to 0.1s (100ms). Schedule all audio events ahead of time. Visual playhead compensates for latency offset.
- ⬜ **Glitch-free playback** — Use AudioWorklet for any custom DSP. Never run audio processing on main thread. Test with 20+ tracks playing simultaneously.
- ✅ **Transport controls** — Play (`Space`), Stop (`Space` × 2 or `Home`), Record (`R`), Loop toggle (`L`). All must respond in < 16ms visually.

### Undo System
- ⬜ **Scoped undo stacks** — Implement separate undo stacks for: global arrangement, per-track, piano roll, mixer. Active scope = currently focused panel.
- ⬜ **Undo for AI actions** — Every AI generation creates a single undo point. "Undo" reverts entire AI action (not individual notes).
- ⬜ **Undo history panel** — Show list of named actions with timestamps. Click to jump to any point (branching undo tree, not just linear).
- ✅ **Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z** — Must always work, in every context, never fail silently.

### Dual-Surface API
- ⬜ **Zustand action parity** — Every UI interaction dispatches the same Zustand action an agent would call. No direct DOM manipulation for state changes.
- ✅ **DAWState.summary** — Auto-generated natural language summary of project state (tracks, BPM, key, structure). Updated on every state change. Used by LLM agents for context.
- ⬜ **Typed action API** — Full TypeScript interface for all DAW actions (see INTERACTION_DESIGN_GUIDE.md §5.1). Export as public API.
- ⬜ **Error responses with suggestions** — When an action fails, return error code + context + actionable suggestions (not just "error occurred").

### Save & Data Persistence
- ✅ **Auto-save** — Every 30 seconds to IndexedDB. No data loss on crash/close.
- ✅ **beforeunload warning** — Warn user if unsaved changes when closing tab.
- ✅ **Project format** — JSON metadata + audio blobs in IndexedDB. Define and document format.
- ✅ **Export: WAV mix** — Full mixdown to WAV file via OfflineAudioContext.

## P1 — Important (Should Ship)

### Timeline & Navigation
- ✅ **Minimap** — Always-visible project overview strip at top of timeline. Shows all clips as colored blocks. Click to navigate.
- ✅ **Zoom gestures** — `Cmd+Scroll` = horizontal zoom, `Cmd+Shift+Scroll` = vertical zoom, pinch on trackpad/touch.
- ⬜ **Zoom to selection** — `Z` zooms to fit selected clips/region. `Shift+Z` zooms to fit entire project.
- ✅ **Adaptive grid** — Grid resolution auto-adjusts based on zoom level (zoomed out = bars, zoomed in = 16th notes).
- ✅ **Snap toggle** — `Cmd+G` toggles snap. Hold `Cmd` while dragging to temporarily disable snap.
- ⬜ **Scrubbing** — Click-drag on timeline ruler to scrub audio. Scrub speed ∝ drag velocity.

### Drag & Drop
- ✅ **OS file drop** — Handle native drag-drop of audio files from Finder/Explorer into timeline. Use File API + `dataTransfer`. Auto-decode and create clip at drop position.
- ✅ **Drag preview ghost** — Show translucent clip preview during drag with snapped position indicator.
- ✅ **Drag between tracks** — Drag clips between tracks (auto-convert MIDI↔audio if needed, or warn).
- ✅ **Drag from loop browser** — One-gesture drag from browser panel to timeline.
- ✅ **Drag reorder** — Reorder tracks via drag-handle on track header.

### Piano Roll (Learn from FL Studio)
- ✅ **Ghost notes** — Show notes from other tracks as 15% opacity background. Toggle with 👻 button.
- ⬜ **Draw/paint tools** — Pencil (single note), paint brush (repeat notes), select, erase. Number keys `1-4` to switch tools.
- ⬜ **Velocity color** — Note color = velocity (light = soft, saturated = loud). Also show velocity bars below piano roll.
- ✅ **Quick quantize** — `Q` quantizes selected notes to current grid. `Cmd+Q` opens quantize dialog with strength slider.
- ⬜ **Chord stamp** — Click to place common chord shapes (maj, min, 7th, dim, etc.). Shortcut: hold `Shift` + click.
- ⬜ **Note resize** — Drag right edge to change duration. Drag left edge to change start (and duration).
- ⬜ **Slide/portamento notes** — Special note type that bends between pitches. Visual: diagonal line between notes.

### AI Generation UX
- ⬜ **Generation panel** — Sidebar panel with: text prompt, style tags, key/BPM/length selectors, temperature slider, variation count.
- ⬜ **Multi-variation output** — Always generate 2-4 variations. Show as they complete (don't wait for all).
- ⬜ **A/B comparison** — Keyboard `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` to switch between variations during playback. Visual indicator of which is active.
- ⬜ **Progress with ETA** — Honest progress bar with estimated time remaining. Never fake progress.
- ⬜ **Inline regeneration** — Select region on timeline → right-click → "Regenerate with AI". New content auto-crossfades at boundaries.
- ⬜ **Prompt history** — Scrollable list of past prompts with timestamps. Click to re-use.
- ⬜ **Prompt autocomplete** — Suggest genres, instruments, moods, techniques as user types.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- ⬜ **Single-key shortcuts** — `Space` play, `R` record, `L` loop, `S` solo, `M` mute, `Z` zoom-to-selection.
- ⬜ **Context-sensitive keys** — Arrow keys do different things in timeline vs piano roll vs mixer.
- ⬜ **Shortcut customization** — Full editor in settings. Import/export presets. Conflict detection.
- ⬜ **DAW migration presets** — Shortcut presets for Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, Pro Tools users.
- ⬜ **Browser conflict prevention** — Prevent `Cmd+W`, `Cmd+T` etc. in DAW context. Use safe alternatives.

### Command Palette
- ⬜ **Cmd+K** — Fuzzy-match command palette. Index every action, parameter, and setting.
- ⬜ **Natural language commands** — "add reverb to vocals" matches "Add Reverb effect to Track: Vocals".
- ⬜ **Recent commands** — Show recently used commands at top.
- ⬜ **Parameter search** — Search for any parameter by name ("kick volume", "reverb decay").
