# ACE-Step DAW

> **Looking for a full-featured, production-ready experience?** Try [ACE Studio](http://acestudio.ai/) — our professional AI music creation platform.

A browser-based Digital Audio Workstation powered by [ACE-Step 1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) for AI music generation. Tracks are generated sequentially in a "LEGO-style" pipeline — each new instrument layer is musically aware of everything generated before it.

## Features

### AI Music Generation
- **LEGO Pipeline** — Sequential generation with cumulative context (drums → bass → guitar → vocals)
- **Cover Generation** — AI-powered cover creation from existing audio
- **Repaint/Edit** — Selective regeneration of specific time ranges
- **Vocal2BGM** — Generate accompaniment from vocal tracks
- **Audio Analysis** — AI-powered BPM, key, and genre detection
- **16 Generation Presets** — Pop, Rock, Jazz, Electronic, Hip-Hop, Classical, Lo-Fi, Ambient
- **Model Selector** — Choose DiT and LM models, LoRA support

### DAW Capabilities
- **Multi-Track Timeline** — Arrangement view with clip-based editing
- **4 Track Types** — Stems (AI-generated), Sample (imported audio), Sequencer (step-based drums), Piano Roll (MIDI)
- **Piano Roll Editor** — Canvas-based MIDI note editor with explicit tool modes, velocity lane, slide notes, and grid snap
- **Step Sequencer** — FL Studio-inspired drum pattern editor with beat pads
- **Effect Chain** — 6 built-in effects (EQ3, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, Distortion, Filter) with per-effect UI
- **Mixer Panel** — Per-track volume, pan, mute, solo, channel strips
- **6 Synth Presets** — Piano, Strings, Pad, Lead, Bass, Organ (Tone.js)
- **16 Drum Sounds** — Synthesized kicks, snares, hi-hats, claps, toms, cymbals (4 kit presets)
- **Loop Browser** — 15 built-in synthesized loops with search, filter, and drag-to-timeline
- **Recording Engine** — Microphone input, real-time waveform, count-in, input level metering
- **Automation** — Breakpoint envelopes with interpolation for volume and pan
- **Smart Controls** — Per-track parameter panels
- **Project Persistence** — Save/load projects via IndexedDB
- **WAV Export** — Bounce mix to stereo WAV file
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Comprehensive shortcut system

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+
- **ACE-Step 1.5 API server** running on `localhost:8001` (default), or use cloud API

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174). The dev server proxies `/api` requests to the ACE-Step 1.5 backend at `localhost:8001`.

### Using Cloud API

To use the ACE-Step cloud API instead of a local server, configure the backend URL in Settings → API URL: `https://api.acemusic.ai`

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **Zustand** (state management)
- **Tone.js** (synth engine, effects, drum synthesis)
- **Web Audio API** (playback, recording, rendering)
- **IndexedDB** via idb-keyval (audio blob storage)
